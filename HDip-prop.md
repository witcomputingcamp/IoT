# IoT Networks and Systems

This module introduces network protocols and computer systems that underpin IoT applications. Topics covered include core operating system functions such as process, memory and file management as well as an introduction to distributed systems and virtualisation. These core principles are then built on to explore key aspects of IoT Systems such as device interfacing, short range and low powered wireless protocols and higher level messaging protocols.
There is an emphasis on applied exercises using IoT prototyping devices, command line tools and scripting.

# IoT Application Development
Internet of Things (IoT) applications combine low-level physical world devices with higher level IT and cloud based services. In this module, students learn how to develop software applications with the connectivity and interoperability required for distributed IoT-based applications. The characteristics and requirements of IoT distributed systems is covered in addition to development platforms and technology standards currently used in IoT applications. The overall focus of this module is the practical design and implementation of full stack IoT-enabled distributed applications.
